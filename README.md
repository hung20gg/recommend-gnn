## This repo will implement GNN in Recommendation System. 

Two of the most popular appoarch for recommendation system is **Colaborative Filtering** and **Session-based**. I have used two different models for these problems.

- **Colaborative Filtering**: [Light-GCN](./colaborative/LightGCN.ipynb)
- **Session-based**: [HG-GNN](./session-based/HG-GNN.ipynb)

This repo is not properly documented. Please be patient!
